# Welcome to Jobbin'!
Jobbin is a simple and easy to use app designed to make job hunting a breeze. Build your own checklist so you never waste time applying to the same job more than once.
With Jobble you can dynamically and effortlessly log different job listings around as you progress in your job search. Just applied to a job? add it to your Applications Table. 3 days later you get an interview for it? drag that sucker into the Interview table! Plus you can create your own tables so whatever it is you need to track, Jobbin's got you covered.

# Start-up
After registering an account, you can immediately begin tracking your job hunt by creating a board. All you have to do is click the "Add Board", give it a name and voila, you made your first Jobbin' board!

Once you've created your board you will be able to add tables. Tables are columns that are able to hold lists of whatever you need to track.

By default, all boards come with 5 tables:

    • Wishlist - tracks the jobs you want and haven't applied to yet

    • Applied - tracks the jobs you have already applied to

    • Interview - tracks interviews that have been scheduled

    • Rejections = tracks rejection letters

    • Offers = tracks job offers
    

But of course you can create your own *Custom Tables* as well! :)

# About this project
This project was made for my MERN Stack project I made while attending the Coding Dojo. This project is meant to showcase my skills as a React developer, implementing beyond what I was taught at the Coding Dojo, and really allowing myself to explore and learn new things.
